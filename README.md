## Getting Started

### How to install?

![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Installing front-o-matic generator

To install generator-front-o-matic from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-front-o-matic
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo front-o-matic
```
There will be just two simple questions.

### Installing front-o-matic generator (TODO))

Build the basic files for development

```
$ grunt

```
Run the server task, it will load a local server for your files and watch the changes to reaload

```
$ grunt

```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
